1. Spring Boot Framework: All the files share the dependency on the Spring Boot Framework. This is a Java-based framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

2. Spring Data JDBC: This is used in the TodoRepository.java and TodoAppApplication.java files. It simplifies the development of JDBC based database applications.

3. Todo Model: The Todo.java file is a model that represents the structure of a Todo item. This model is used in the TodoController.java and TodoRepository.java files.

4. TodoRepository Interface: This interface is defined in TodoRepository.java and is used in TodoController.java for CRUD operations.

5. SQL Statements: The SQL statements are defined in the todo-queries.sql file and are used in the TodoRepository.java file to perform CRUD operations.

6. Application Properties: The application.properties file contains configuration properties. These properties are shared across the application, including the TodoAppApplication.java file.

7. Maven: The pom.xml file is a Project Object Model (POM) file in Maven. It contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project. It is shared across the entire project.

8. TodoController: The TodoController.java file contains the API endpoints for the Todo application. It uses the TodoRepository interface and the Todo model.

9. TodoAppApplication: The TodoAppApplication.java file is the entry point for the Spring Boot application. It uses the Spring Boot Framework and Spring Data JDBC.
